b'2013-11-23',"b'TERRIBLE. Keep in mind that the entire experience below took less than five minutes...\n\nI recently had a consultation with Dr. Karnavas for a new retainer. My mouth is very small and my bite is very tight, so I am unable to use standard impression trays to have molds made of my teeth. (I know this after visiting King Orthodontics earlier in the year and having no luck with even his smallest/pediatric trays.) Therefore, before I went to Karnavas\' office, I purchased a bunch of foam fluoride trays that dentists use for her to JUST TRY. I understood they might not work, but I figured there was no harm in trying. Apparently, Karnavas DOES NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO TRY and help her patients NOR DOES SHE POSSESS ANY PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS WHATSOEVER.\n\nUpon entering the exam room, I explained to Karnavas my situation, and, before even seeing the foam trays, she immediately told me they wouldn\'t work because they were too shallow. A valid point had she maybe LOOKED AT THE TRAYS or LOOKED IN MY MOUTH at all. Oh, did I forget to mention that she DID NOT ONCE ASK TO EXAMINE MY TEETH? NOT ONCE did she expresses ANY interest in examining my mouth, which was SHOCKING since King Orthodontics had done a full consult with me that included an exam, photos, X-rays, etc. (BTW, the people at King are fantastic; I just didn\'t have foam trays back when I saw them.) \n\nRepeatedly I tried to explain that conventional impression trays wouldn\'t fit into my very small mouth and asked if we could please just TRY the foam tray? No. SHE REFUSED. \n\nI then asked what she suggested that I do, and she told me that it was ""up to me."" ""Up to me"" except that she repeatedly negated my idea of what I wanted to try. WHAT KIND OF PROFESSIONAL leaves diagnosis and problem-solving up to the PATIENT?! A COMPLETELY CLUELESS ONE, that\'s what kind. I even asked to see her smallest impression tray, but she skirted around that as well and I never did get to see any of her equipment. \n\nFinally I became so exasperated that I told her it didn\'t make sense for me to waste her supplies and time (because CLEARLY I WAS WASTING HER TIME) trying to do something that\'s been proven not to work. She simply said ""OK"" and walked out of the room.\n\nOne final thing that I thought was really odd and extremely uninviting: Karnavas kept her mask on the entire meeting. Meaning, I NEVER saw her full face. She had it on when she entered the room, when I introduced myself to her (SHE DID NOT INTRODUCE HERSELF), and when she was talking to me. STRANGE, considering (again) that SHE NEVER EXAMINED MY MOUTH. \n\nSo, to recap:\n- Lacks problem-solving skills and the ability to try\n- Clueless\n- Lazy\n- Extremely impersonal and uninviting\n\nOr maybe I\'m wrong. Maybe she\'s just disinterested in helping 30-year-old women in wheelchairs that offer to pay out of pocket.'",b'review',1,2,0,1,b'uRJCA6--yrMgvYz246uu_Q',b'3FUUb4SjXJc5BkZr2Jpgdg',b'cgOANdIpAy1NLDP351H5zQ'

b'2011-05-11',"b'I stopped by Monday, the first day I felt it was nice enough to take my munchkin for a stroller ride.I like the simple clean layout of this place,no clutter and you can see a lot of the kitchen always a good sign. I asked the woman working the counter for suggestion. She pointed out the chocolate thumbprints and while she bagged those up I spied individual pineapple upside down cakes. So I scored 4 cookies and 2 lil cakes. The cookies were very good mixture of firm and gooey. The cake was realllllly delicious.Moist with a crispy kinda crust outside,just perfect. My husband did get his cake but i really had to restrain myself because he left it for over 24 hours! I ate all 4 cookies.'",b'review',4,0,0,0,b'_H7YQYiXToV0paIoOeFNng',b'Sktj1eHQFuVa-M4bgnEh8g',b'P3O7Kl325V28q27NRfar7A'

b'2012-06-10',"b'My first experience with this bakery today (June 9, 2012). Picked up a cake for my husband\'s 40th birthday. Decoration was nice and spelled correctly, cake was moist and nice, buttercream icing lovely and smooth, and overall a great job. The walk in space was a little small and they seemed busy today, but this place seems to know what they are doing. \n\nIncongruously, for no apparent reason, they were also selling a shelf full of bananas in plastic bags (um, OK?) and they sell bottled drinks and coffee too, but they force you to use styrofoam cups for the coffee-- I would suggest reusable mugs be allowed, or something else more environmentally sound.\n\nCounter help and girl on phone were polite but could speak up a little more. Their preprinted order slips indicate a space for ""salesgirl"" to sign, instead of ""salesperson"" so I\'d suggest  a change on that.\n\nOverall: Great and tasty and pretty, and suited our needs.'",b'review',5,0,0,0,b'eG9O6rIrKDh1CKUH6ecZHw',b'3FUUb4SjXJc5BkZr2Jpgdg',b'btMrALcpDpZV5x2CainAqw'
